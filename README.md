## Machine Collections

  I don‚Äôt have time and energy to read these articles every day, but I‚Äôd like to catch up with the best recent content.

  Thankfully, we have machines for that. As a reader I login to the app and create a new ‚Äúcollection‚Äù with a name like ‚ÄúBest of JS‚Äù. Within the collection I can target some specific tags (maybe using my followed tags as suggestions). Then, each week, the app generates a collection based on posts published that week in those tags, prioritizing them by the number of reads. That collection is browseable at a unique URL.

  Extensions:
  The collection has a publicly-sharable URL, so that you can tweet it out, I can click the link, and see a listing page of all the articles in the collection.
  When I click articles in the collection, mark them as read
  Display which articles I have and haven‚Äôt read
  Display how many times each article in the collection has been read
  Allow the reader to make articles as ‚ÄúNot Interested‚Äù and grey them out
  Implement some sorting in the listing display like ‚ÄúPublished Date‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdded Date‚Äù, ‚ÄúMost Popular‚Äù# Code Annotations - 

## Extension Background
- Dev.to is a website that allows users to write articles, follow fellow writers and bookmark.  Bookmarked articles will appear in a ReadingList view.  This view `/readingList` will be extended to include another component called `collectionList` and will have sub components that are `collectionListItems` that render the title of a collection.  When a user clicks on that collection title, they are taken to a rails view (show or index) of that collection and associated articles.  The machine collections takes a tag and searches once a week for articles assoicated to that collection/tag.

<details><summary>Files of the Front End</summary>

  ## -> Validations

  - ReadingList has some prop checking
  - /Users/josho/turing/4module/projects/dev.to.local/app/javascript/src/components/common-prop-types 

## -> ERB View: Loading the Index view of ReadingList 

  - /Users/josho/turing/4module/projects/dev.to.local/app/views/reading_list_items/index.html.erb
  - `<%= javascript_pack_tag "readingList", defer: true %>`
  - This file loads the pack and ultimately the javacript/react for ReadList
  - This is where we will load a CollectionListItem for our collections list

  ## -> Reading List Pack

  - /Users/josho/turing/4module/projects/dev.to.local/app/javascript/packs/readingList.jsx
  - This if used by Webpack to load the ReadingList component and associated files

  ## -> Reading List

  - /Users/josho/turing/4module/projects/dev.to.local/app/javascript/readingList/readingList.jsx
  - This file renders the readingsList component as well as a newly minted component `collectionList`

  ## -> Collections Endpoint: Populate Collections Component  

  - An api call to the readlingList.jsx file to populate a collectionListItems on the `readinglist`   
  - `getCollections = (userId) => {
    const url =`api/${userId}/collections`
    fetch(url)
    .then(response => {
    return response.json()})
    .then((data) => {
    this.setState({
      collectionItems: data.data
    })
  })
  .catch((error) => console.log(error))} `

  ## -> Create a `collectionListItem` component 

  - To be populated with the fetch call 
  - file is located at `/app/javascript/src/components/CollectionList/CollectionListItem.jsx`
  ````export const CollectionListItem = ({ title, collectionId, userId }) => {
  const path = `${ userId }/collections/${ collectionId }`
  return (
    <div className='item-wrapper'>
      <a className="item" href={path}>
        <div className="item-title">
          {title}
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
  )
  };
  ````

<details> <summary>Dataflow of the Back End </summary>

## Dev.to backend

- The machine_collections table and MachineCollection model have attributes of a title, slug, cached_tag_list, and a foreign key of a user id.
- When a user clicks a link to create a new collection, they are routed to ```"/:user_id/collections/new"``` and hit ```machine_collections_controller#new```, which displays a view to create a new collection
- A user can enter a title for a collection and select a tag for their collection. The title and tag are sent as params in the create action.
- When a user clicks submit, a post request is sent to ```"/:user_id/collections"```, which hits ```"machine_collections#create"```.
- Within this create method, a new collection is created based off of the collection_params (the title, selected tag, and user id).
- The list of collections that are displayed within the collections component are retrieved with a fetch to the api endpoint ```"/api/:user_id/collections"```, which hits ```"/api/machine_collections#index"``` and gathers all collections associated with a specific user.
- Once a collection has been created, the user can click the title of a collection within the collections component. The user is routed to ```"/:user_id/collections/:id"```, which hits ```"machine_collections#show"``` and displays that collection's show page.
- The show method calls on a method, ```articles_past_seven_days```, within the MachineCollection model that queries the database for articles that have a tag that matches the collection's cached_tag_list (only holds one tag right now) and were written in the last seven days. The query displays articles from greatest to least number of page views.
